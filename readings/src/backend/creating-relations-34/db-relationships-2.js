// terms:

    // one-to-one relationship: a relationship where a single record in one table is related to a single record in another table, and neither column has duplicate records

    // one-to-many relationship: a relationship where a single record in one table is related to multiple records in another table

        // Create a foreign key column on the 'many' side of the relationship to the primary key column on the 'one' side of the relationship.

    // many-to-many relationship: a relationship where multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table

        // You need to create an intermediate table, called a join table. A join table contains two foreign key columns to store the relationships between the two tables.
