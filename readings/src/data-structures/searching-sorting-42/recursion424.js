    // overview: A function that calls itself is called a recursive function, and that's exactly what you'll learn about in this lesson.

// terms:

    // recursion: a problem-solving method that involves a function calling itself

    // top-down recursive function: a function that calculates the solutions to each subproblem in the forward phase, passing the results of the calculation to the recursive call

    // bottom-up recursive function: a function that breaks down the problem into increasingly smaller problems until the base case is encountered, and then combines the solutions in the backward phase

    // stack overflow error: a runtime error where the call stack gets too big and runs out of space

    // forward phase: also called the recursive phase, the phase that happens when the function is calling itself and continues until the base case is satisfied

    // backward phase: also called the back-out phase, the phase that starts when a functin call satisfies the base case, then returns a value to the function that called it, and continues until a value is returned to the initial function call

    // base case: the solution to the 'simplest' possible problem; this case provides a terminating condition for the recursive case

    // recursive case: where you call the same function to solve increasingly simple versions of the problem
