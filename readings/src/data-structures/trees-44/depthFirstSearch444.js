// Trees 44

// Depth-First Search 44.4

    // overview: Searching through trees can be done in a few different ways. A depth-first search is one of the most common ways. You will be able to implement in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree traversals.

// terms:

    // depth-first search: DFS, a tree-traversal algorithm that starts from the root node, explores as far as possible in a subtree, and then backtracks before moving to the next subtree

    // in-order traversal: traversal in which the left branch of the node is visited, then the current node is handled, and then the right branch is visited

    // pre-order traversal: traversal in which the current node is handled first, then the left branch of the node is visited, and then the right branch is visited

    // post-order traversal: traversal in which the left branch of the node is visited, then the right branch is visited, and then the current node is handled last
