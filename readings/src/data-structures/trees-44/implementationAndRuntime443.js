// Trees 44

// Implementation And Runtime 44.3

    // overview: By the end of this lesson, you will be able to implement insertion, retrieval, and removal of nodes in a BST. You'll also be able to define the runtime of various operations on a BST.

// terms:

    // balanced tree: a tree in which each row contains two times as many nodes as the row before
