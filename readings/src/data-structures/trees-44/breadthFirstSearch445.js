// Bread-First Search 44.5

    // overview: learn to implement and analyze the complexity of a breadth-first search algorithm to use to traverse a tree

// terms:

    // breadth-first search: BFS, a tree-traversal algorithm that starts at the root node and proceeds level by level

// See './data-structures-and-algorithms/week16/breadth-first-search-445.js' for notes and code examples.
