// Why Study Algorithms? 41.3

    // overview: In this lesson, you will examine some of the reasons why the study of algorithms is essential.

// Some Real-World Algorithms

    // Google's PageRank Algorithm

        // PageRank is one of the algorithms that Google uses to order search results. This algorithm attempts to measure the importance of a web page and its relevance to your search query.

    // Internet Routing

        // The internet is made up of millions of nodes (computers and routers and other devices) that are all connected together in a vast array of connections. Moving data from one computer to another is an extremely complicated task.

        // To make this all work, there are a series of different routing algorithms that attempt to find the fastest route from your computer to any other computer that you are connected to on the internet.

        // The problem of routing is an area of active research. As internet access continues to grow cheaper, the number of nodes grows, and it becomes more and more critical to identify more efficient algorithms to enable routing.

    // Cryptography

        // Encryption is used to secure communication on the internet. If you have ever used online banking, done a credit card transaction, or even used an online email service like Gmail, then you have used an encryption algorithm.

    // Ride-sharing

        // The ride-sharing service wishes to optimize the use of its drivers and minimize idle time as well as wait times for its customers. Tracking numerous drivers on the move and numerous customers waiting for rides is a complex task that requires sophisticated algorithms.

    // GPS

        // GPS works by synchronizing atomic clocks on a constellation of satellites orbiting the Earth with a ground-based control system and your phone. The algorithms involved are as complex as anything that humankind has ever created.

// A well designed algorithm on a slower computer can be leagues faster than a poor designed algorithm on a faster computer.
